The two players have a set of pieces (pawn, knight, bishop, queen, king) and can move them in alternating turns on the board according to precise rules of movement.</p>\n  <img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8j8z1tj9aqpsej2/ChessboardPosition.png?dl=1\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\">\n<p>People have been trying to write programs that could play perfect chess games since 1951. The first person to write a program to move the pieces on the board in the best possible way was Alan Turing. The program is called <a href=\"https://www.chessprogramming.org/Turochamp\">Turochamp</a>.<br>\nIn recent years, chess engines have surpassed the level of humans but are still unable to make perfect games from the first move to the last. This is due to the fact that all possible moves in a chess game are 10^123. This number was calculated by Claude Shannon and took the name \"Shannon's number\". </p>\n\n<p>A chess game is divided into 3 parts: <b>Opening</b>, the initial part of the game in which space is given to the pieces. <b>Middlegame</b>, the middle part of the game, is the longest and most reasoned part. Moreover, it is the least textbook part; players try to make strategies and tactics to get to the final part of the game with an advantage. The final part is called the <b>endgame</b>, and here players try to finish the game with a win.</p>\n\n<p> <b>The goal</b> of this work is to create a model that predicts the next move during a chess game. <b>The challenge</b>, however, is to make the model as if the chess game is a conversation. So the moves take the place of the words and the game becomes a conversation. To do this I need a neural network that can generate text. So as to make a chess game an exchange of words between two people. </p>\n\n<p>In order to manage the dataset, Spark has been used. Concerning the Machine Learning parts, Keras and Tensorflow have been used for implementations.<br>\nThe project was developed on Databricks Community Edition, Kaggle, and Paperspace. Since Databricks does not provide a gpu, Kaggle and Paperspace were used because they provide this possibility. After the data preparation cells for learning, these data were saved in Databricks DBFS in order to export and use them on other platforms. Once used, the produced cells were reported on this notebook and the produced outputs were imported through Dropbox. all cells reported from other platforms were re-run on databricks to show that it works. The cells containing model fits have been executed to demonstrate the functionality of the code but then blocked because it have already been executed externally. These cells are always followed by cells used to import the relative models.</p>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"88ed2cec-6e1a-4570-98ef-d975e5fdc93c"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Neural Network Background\n#### Since the same Neural Network was used for all approaches, it is explained in the introduction to avoid repetition to the reader while reading the notebook\n\n\n<p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) deal with my task. Indeed, the RNN taking sequences as input and modeling them over time. But RNNs have a problem, they can't store sequences that are too long. So LSTM neural networks are used. LSTM is a RNN created to solve the problem of RNNs. These networks can process sequences of data and maintain their states for a long time using different types of gates. When a new input comes in RNN, it modifies the existing information without deciding if the incoming input is important or not, whereas in the case of LSTM gates are available to allow only important inputs to modify the existing information.\n</p> <br>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufsxap9xq59jjhl/RNNVSLSTM.jpg?dl=1\"> <br>\n\n<p>In more detail, RNNs during the processing of their data in addition to the input also use the output of the previous step. In the LSTM it works the same way, but there is an internal state. So the input to be processed will not only be that given by the input and the output of the previous step but also an additional input given by the internal state. Once these 3 data are processed, the processing provides not only the output but also an update to the internal state. The internal state consists of 3 parts. <b>Forget Gate</b>, Input state and output state. Forget state is used for This gate is for selecting relevant information and discarding irrelevant information. The data is passed through a sigmoid function that returns a value between 0 and 1, if it returns 0 the information is ignored otherwise considered within the input. <b>Input Gate</b> is resposible for adding information to the model. It create an array of information that contains value from -1 to 1 with the tanh function. This value is filtered by the sigmoid function that mantain the relevant information should be added or updated into the internal state. The <b>Output Gate</b> is responsible for generating outputs. In particuar between all the information that are stored in a state which part of it should be output in this particular instace. These gates are part of the network parameters and are learned during the training.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>This neural network is used in this work, below you can see the general architecture of the network used. </p>\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx5gzq5fyl2xgpo/LSTM_Architecture.jpg?dl=1\"> <br>\n<p>In the 3 proposed approaches, the network used generally follows the reported architecture.  For each approach, more than one model was trained. In some models the networks may be slightly different, changes affect the numbers of units for the LSTM networks, and dropouts were added or not added and at different percentage rates. These changes were made to increase model performance and to evaluate the different shades of the network during evaluation</p>\n\n## Use of data in the network\n\n<p>Data within the lstm network were passed using the sliding window technique. This technique consists of breaking sentences (in the case of this work chess games) into arrays of fixed length so that the chosen sentence is covered all over.<br>\nFor example, the sliding window of the sentence \"the man is walking down the street.\" is: </p>\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3d4fc2zzim1of08/slide_window.jpeg?dl=1\"> <br>\n<p>In this work the approaches differ in this aspect. The data are handled in the same way but are modeled differently. the modeling started from a very raw granularity of the move, considering only the piece, to the move that also includes disambiguations.</p>\n\n<p>Peculiarities of algebraic notation (it is explained in the \"Chess Background\" section) were not considered in all approaches. The features not considered are: piece takes (the \"x\" symbol in the move ), check and ckeckmate. It was not considered since these are features that need the state of the chessboard. Since chessboard state is not used in this project these types of moves were modified without these features. For example, the move Nxf3 will be considered as Nf3. </p>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"387c5caf-2e50-4f7a-8e1a-d71575221988"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Evaluation Background\n#### Since the same methods of evaluation was used for all approaches, it is explained in the introduction to avoid repetition to the reader while reading the notebook\n\n<p>Two types of evaluations were made, one Extrinsic and one Intrinsic.</p>\n<p><b>The Extrinsic evaluation</b>, it was measured how often the models correctly predicted the moves played in the test set games. Using this method, since the model has never seen the games used in evaluation, it is as if high-level players play with hints given by the models, and if one of them accepts the hint, the model's score is increased.</p>\n<p>In <b>The Intrinsic  evaluation</b> metrics to evaluate the model are used. Compared to Extrinsic evaluation, the context of use is lost. In this work the <b>perplexity</b> metric was used. Perplexity is a measurement of how well a probability model predicts a sample.<br>\nThe perplexity is calculated with the formula below:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/qrbz6aykypi5tam/perplexity.png?dl=1\"> \n<p>The perplexity is calculated as the multiplication between all the probabilities of the predictions made during a game by normalizing the multiplication by the number of moves to be predicted. <br>\nIn this work, in evaluation phase, the model made predictions and the probabilities of each prediction were multiplied and then normalized. At the end of evaluation each model has a perplexity list that defines the perplexities for all the test set matches seen.

This notation is also used for this work. First, this notation involves naming the cells of the chessboard with a letter to identify the column and a number to identify the row related to the cell. </p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/njage6me1mxni0m/Notation.png?dl=1\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\">\n\n<p>The <b>pieces</b> are identified with an uppercase letter: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, and N for knight. When no piece is indicated on the move we refer to pawns.</p>\n<p>Each <b>move</b>of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square. For example, Nf3 means that the Knight is moved in the cell f3. </p>\n<p>If the knight in cell f3 takes an opponent's piece, an \"x\" will be added just after the piece and the move will become \"Nxf3\". </p>\n<p> Another distinction is made between pieces of the same color. Having two knights available, if both can go into the f3 cell, we need to distinguish between them. To <b>disambiguate the moves</b> there are 2 ways.If the pieces are distinguishable on the basis of the column, we place the identifying letter of the column after the piece letter. For example, One knight is on d4, the other is on g5, both can go to f3, but we want to move the one that is on d4 and so the move will be \"Ndf3\". If the knight on f3 takes an opponent's piece, the move becomes Ndxf3. Instead, if The knights are on the same column, for example, one knight is on d2 and one is on d4, we will distinguish the two pieces by noting the line on which they are placed. For example, if we want to move the knight to d4 the move will be \"N4f3\", the same rule applies for the \"x\", if with this move the knight takes a piece the \"x\" should be put after the disambiguation and before the cell. </p>\n<p>When a pawn arrives in the last row of the column, it can be changed to another piece at will, this move is called <b>pawn promotion</b>. In case the white pawn in the column in and is promoted to queen the move will be \"e8Q\".</p>\n<p>In chess it is possible to make some special moves such as <b>Castling</b>. Castling is a special move to protect the king. It's the only time in chess you can move two pieces in one move. The king moves two squares to the right or left and the rook moves directly to the other side of the king. You can only castle if neither the rook or king have moved and there are no pieces in the way. Depending on where the king moves, whether he \"swaps\" position with the rook closest to him is called kingside castling and is identified with the \"0-0\" string. However, if it is exchanged with the rook closest to the queen it is called queenside castling and the move is identified with \"0-0-0\". </p>\n<p>The situation in which the king is under attack from an opposing piece is called <b>check</b>. A move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the symbol \"+\" at the end of the move. For example, \"Nc7+\". </p>\n<p>If the king is under attack by two pieces at the same time, it is called a <b>double check</b> and is marked ++. For example, \"Bh6++\".</p>\n<p>The situation in which one of the two kings is attacked by an opponent's piece and the player has no more legal moves to play is called <b>checkmate</b>. The move that led to checkmate is marked by # at the end. for example, \"Qh8#\".</p>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"2639b80e-2cae-4b7c-a2e8-dd000caa6d3d"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Section 1: Dataset presentation\n<p> I this section the dataset is loaded, we do an exploration on the dataset and prepare it for the task</p>\n<p>The dataset was chosen by kaggle, and can be found <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milesh1/35-million-chess-games\">here</a>.

The perplexity of these models follows a similar pattern. The model with the reduced dictionary has an average complexity of 1.9 which is lower than the others. The perplexity of the trained models without frequencies, on the other hand, follows a different trand than the correct predictions. The model with the worst perplexity is still model 1, with an average perplexity of 5.4.
